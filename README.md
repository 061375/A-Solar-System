# A-Solar-System
Fun with a solar system simulation

## TO DO
* Evenly distribute planets around the sun.
* Multiple suns
* Collision
* Collision with basic accresion
  - Simulate the creation of a solar system from smaller particles
  - Basically smaller planets will be inherited into larger
  - In the case of same size just combine and their direction will be an average
* Destructive collisions
  - Actual destruction simulation and later acression
* Friction
  - Not much of that in space but there is some
* Control over planet creation
  - Ability to add planet at location
  - Abiltiy to specify planets size
  - Ability to add planets speed and direction

# TO DO ( Maybe )
* Better look and feel
* Abilty to launch probe from planet to destination
* Planet statistics
